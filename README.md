## Features

- Basic Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Scientific Functions: Trigonometry, Logarithms, Exponentiation
- Supports Constants: `Ï€` (Pi), `e` (Euler's number)
- Customizable Modes: Radians and Degrees for trigonometric calculations
- Interactive REPL Mode for multiple calculations
- Error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases
- Expandable and modular architecture

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later
- A terminal or command-line interface

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd scientific-calculator
   ```
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
4. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin ScientificCalculatorApp
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
Start the calculator in interactive mode:
```bash
java -cp bin ScientificCalculatorApp
```
- Enter mathematical expressions (e.g., `2 + 3 * sin(45)`).
- Type `exit` or `quit` to exit the application.

### Command-Line Mode
Evaluate a single expression directly:
```bash
java -cp bin ScientificCalculatorApp "2 + 3 * sin(45)"
```

### Example Commands
```text
> 2 + 3 * 5
Result: 17

> sin(90)
Result: 1.0

> log(10)
Result: 1.0

> factorial(5)
Result: 120
```

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture for maintainability and scalability. Key components:

1. **Main Application (`ScientificCalculatorApp`)**:
   - Entry point for the application.
2. **Command Line Interface (`CommandLineInterface`)**:
   - Handles user input/output.
3. **Core Calculator (`Calculator`)**:
   - Processes and evaluates expressions.
4. **Utilities**:
   - `MathUtils`: Basic and advanced math functions.
   - `TrigUtils`: Trigonometric utilities.
   - `ExpressionParser`: Expression validation and parsing.
   - `Constants`: Common scientific constants.
5. **Error Handling (`CalculatorException`)**:
   - Custom exceptions for invalid inputs.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Unit Conversions**: Add functionality for converting between units (e.g., meters to feet).
- **History Tracking**: Save and load previous calculations.
- **Matrix Operations**: Add support for matrix algebra.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Build a desktop or web interface.
